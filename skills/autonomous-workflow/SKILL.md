  Proposal-first development workflow with commit hygiene and decision authority rules.
  Enforces: propose before modifying, atomic commits, no force flags, warnings-as-errors.
  Use for any project where AI agents are primary developers and need guardrails.

# Autonomous Workflow

## Proposal-First (CRITICAL)

NEVER create or modify files without explicit approval. Always:

1. PROPOSE the change (what, why, which files)
2. WAIT for approval
3. IMPLEMENT only after approval

Exceptions: bug fixes in already-approved work, read-only research, formatting.

## Decision Authority (for approved work)

- Fix bugs, warnings, missing error handling, broken imports: proceed without asking
- Add missing tests, fix linting issues, update outdated deps: proceed without asking
- Change architecture, add new infrastructure, switch libraries: ASK first
- Delete or significantly restructure existing code: ASK first

## After Every Change

- Run the relevant test suite
- Run the linter/type checker
- Fix ALL warnings, not just errors
- Run the project's formatter on changed files

## Unused Variables

- NEVER prefix unused variables with underscore (_var) to silence linters
- Either USE the variable or REMOVE it entirely
- If a function parameter is required by an interface but unused, restructure to avoid it
- This applies to all languages: TypeScript, Rust, Python

## Commit Hygiene

- Never use --force, --no-verify, HUSKY=0 without explicit permission
- Never commit .env files, credentials, or secrets
- Atomic commits: one logical change per commit
- Never add `Co-authored-by`, `Ultraworked with`, or any AI agent attribution to commits, PRs/MRs,
  comments, or changelogs. Keep commit messages clean and focused on the change itself.

## Fresh Context for Large Work

Before starting large implementations (multi-phase plans, migrations, new stack deployments):

- Commit and push all preparatory work (plans, config updates)
- Start a fresh session / compact context to maximize available context window
- Reference the plan file for implementation details rather than relying on conversation history

## Continuous Config Improvement

Agent instructions are living documents. When you discover something that should be codified -- a new
pattern, a gotcha, a convention, a lesson learned -- PROPOSE updating the relevant config file:

1. **What to codify**: Recurring mistakes, new conventions, environment-specific gotchas, workflow
   patterns that should be standardized
2. **Always propose first**: Never silently update config files. Describe what you learned and why
   it should be codified. Wait for approval.
